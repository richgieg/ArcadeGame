# Arcade Game

This is the third project in my pursuit of the Front-End Web Developer
Nanodegree from Udacity. Following is Udacity's description for this project:

"You will learn JavaScriptâ€™s object-oriented programming features to write
eloquently designed classes capable of creating countless instances of similarly
functioning objects. You will discover a variety of ways inheritance and
delegation can be used to create well architected and performant applications.
Games have a lot of objects and those objects do a lot of different things; but
sometimes those objects do some very similar things as well. This creates a
great opportunity to practice object-oriented programming, an important
programming paradigm that influences your application architecture as well as
provides performance optimizations."
